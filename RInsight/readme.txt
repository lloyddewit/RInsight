-------------- RInsight Nuget Readme  --------------
----------------------------------------------------

This library parses script written in the R programming language and creates a .NET recursive 
object model of the R statements and their components. The object model can be easily analyzed and 
updated within the .NET environment. If needed, the library can also generate new R script from an 
updated model. This library has potential applications within R editors, R formatters, R GUI 
builders and R static analysis tools. For an example of this library in use, please see
